### Usage and Explanation of Options ###

To use AU, you utilize the "working-folder". In the "working-folder" after the installation guide are four more directories: 

framework-here - to be used with framework files when decompiling and building apks (ie. com.htc.resources.apk and framework-res.apk)

mod-here-multi - to be used when modifying multiple apks or files

mod-here-solo - to be used when modifying single apks or files

ninepatch - to be used strictly for draw9patch images


These are the options available:

1. adb tools - A suite for all your basic and advance Android Debug Bridge (adb) tools. Includes functions such as: adb push, adb pull, adb restart, adb shell, adb remount, adb install, adb devices, and also has a useful adb guide (Option I).

2. keystore manager - A suite for creating and storing all your private keys. Also can be used to sign apks with private keys.

3. sign apk and update.zip - Does what it says. Signs apks with test or private keys and signs update.zips with test keys.

4. zipalign - A suite to allow the user to zipalign apks. Also has information on the zipalign process.

5. CREDITS - Runs the Credits Screen. Big thanks to all those who have given me sound advice and whose tools I've used.

6. apk Re-Engineering - A suite to utilize the goodness of Brut.all's apktool. Allows fast access to versions 1.3.1, 1.3.2, and 1.4.1 and also fast access to different versions of aapt.

7. smali and baksmali - Feature will come in a future release. Stay tuned.

8. PNG optimize - Feature will come in a future release. Stay tuned.

9. draw9patch utilities - A suite to allow the user to recompile RAW or SOURCE 9.png. Also has the option to decompile already compiled 9.png.

10. apk compression method - A suite to allow the user to set a different compression level for apks. Pro = faster access and easier on RAM. Con = larger file size

x. Run Installation Guide - Opens up the installation Guide. Good for installing the working-folder and additional add-ons.
