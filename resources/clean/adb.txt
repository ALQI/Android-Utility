Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command line tool that
lets you communicate with an emulator instance or connected
Android-powered device. It is a client-server program that includes
three components:
-	A client, which runs on your development machine. You can 
	invoke a client from a shell by issuing an adb command. Other
	Android tools such as the ADT plugin and DDMS also create
	adb clients.
-	A server, which runs as a background process on your
	development machine. The server manages communication
	between the client and the adb daemon running on an emulator
	or device.
-	A daemon, which runs as a background process on each
	emulator or device instance.

### Issuing adb Commands

You can issue adb commands from a command line on your development machine or from a script. The usage is:

	adb [-d|-e|-s <serialNumber>] <command>
